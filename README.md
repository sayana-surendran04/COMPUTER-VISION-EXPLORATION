•	Grayscale Conversion: Converting a color image to black and white.
Image Filtering and Enhancement:
•	Gaussian Blur: Reduces noise and blurs the image.
•	Median Filtering: Removes noise while preserving edges.
•	Histogram Equalization: Stretches the contrast of an image.

Part 2: Image Classification and Deep Learning

Dataset: CIFAR-10 dataset (contains 10 classes of images)
Pre-trained Model: VGG16
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of around 85% on the validation set.
Fine-tuning a Pre-trained CNN:
•	Model Architecture: Used VGG16 as the base model.
•	Training Process:
o	Freeze the initial layers of the VGG16 model to preserve learned features.
o	Replace the final classification layer with a new layer suitable for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
o	Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on updating the newly added layers.
